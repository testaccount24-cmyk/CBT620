Nice to meet you.
My name is Hiroyuki Konishi.
I am a Japanese system programmer.
I do a contribution for the first time this time.
I offer a program to develop a COPY statement with ANS COBOL.
COPY statement begin from 12 column.
Member name begin from 17 column.

Purpose of the MWCBLCPY program:

 Normally in COBOL programs, COPY statements can only occur in
 the PROCEDURE DIVISION.  Using my program, you can put COPY
 statements anywhere in the COBOL program, and before compiling,
 you run the modified source (with the extra COPY statements)
 through my program, and THEN into the COBOL compiler.  Please
 see member $SAMPJCL for more complete sample JCL.

 As stated above, the COPY statement must begin in column 12, and
 the pds member name to be copied, must begin in column 17.

I show a sample COBOL coding in the following.

002700*
002800 FD  SAMPLE-FILE                 BLOCK  0  RECORDS
002900                                 LABEL  RECORD  STANDARD
003000                                 RECORDING  MODE  IS  F.
003100 01  SAMPLE-REC.
003200     COPY SAMPREC.
003300*

I show a sample JCL in the following.  See also member $SAMPJCL.

//        EXEC PGM=MWCBLCPY,REGION=1024K
//STEPLIB   DD DSN=xxxx.xxxx.xxxx,DISP=SHR
//SYSLIB    DD DSN=xxxx.xxxx.xxxx,DISP=SHR           <=copy   library
//SYSIN     DD DSN=xxxx.xxxx.xxxx(xxxx),DISP=SHR     <=COBOL  source
//SYSLIN    DD DSN=&xxxx,DISP=(MOD,PASS),UNIT=SYSDA, <=output source
//             SPACE=(80,(500,100))                  <= to feed into
                                                     <= the compiler.
