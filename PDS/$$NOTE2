Hi Sam,

These are my answers.

My Program is a main Program and a precompiler.

Because ANS COBOL was weak in a function COPY statement, I wrote my
program.

COPY statement of ANS COBOL is usable only with PROCEDURE DIVISION.

You can use COPY statement in all steps of your program by
using my program.

I attach a sample JCL. (See member $SAMPJCL.)

Thank you for your work.

Sincerely, Hiroyuki Konishi
