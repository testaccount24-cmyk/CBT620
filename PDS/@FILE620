//***FILE 620 is from Hiroyuki Konishi and is an Assembler          *   FILE 620
//*           program which is a precompiler for COBOL programs,    *   FILE 620
//*           so you can copy pieces of code from members of a      *   FILE 620
//*           pds, to make a single source program to feed into     *   FILE 620
//*           the COBOL compiler.  See the member $SAMPJCL for      *   FILE 620
//*           sample JCL to run this program.                       *   FILE 620

//*           The idea is to extend the concept of COPY members     *   FILE 620
//*           into any part of a COBOL program, not just the        *   FILE 620
//*           PROCEDURE DIVISION segments of code.                  *   FILE 620

//*    Purpose of the MWCBLCPY program:                             *   FILE 620
//*                                                                 *   FILE 620
//*     Normally in COBOL programs, COPY statements can only        *   FILE 620
//*     occur in the PROCEDURE DIVISION.  Using my program,         *   FILE 620
//*     you can put COPY statements anywhere in the COBOL           *   FILE 620
//*     program, and before compiling, you run the modified         *   FILE 620
//*     source (with the included COPY statements) through my       *   FILE 620
//*     program, and THEN into the COBOL compiler.  Please see      *   FILE 620
//*     member $SAMPJCL for more complete sample JCL.  My           *   FILE 620
//*     program will expand the COPY statements by copying the      *   FILE 620
//*     named pds member inline into the program source code.       *   FILE 620
//*                                                                 *   FILE 620
//*     As stated above, the COPY statement must begin in           *   FILE 620
//*     column 12, and the pds member name to be copied, must       *   FILE 620
//*     begin in column 17.  The member to be copied, must          *   FILE 620
//*     exist in the //SYSLIB library.                              *   FILE 620
